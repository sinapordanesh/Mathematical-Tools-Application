# Mathematical Tools Application

This is a simple application built using C# and Visual Studio that contains various numerical and geometrical tools. The application is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and features a complete Visual Studio GUI.


## Futures

### Numerical Tools
- Calculator: Perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Number Ordering: Input a set of numbers and orders them in either ascending or descending order.

### Geometrical Tools
- Circular Tools: Calculate the area, circumference, diam-eter, and radius of a circle, as well as the volume and surface area of a sphere.

- Triangular Tools: Allows the user to calculate the area, perimeter, and angles of a triangle.

### Numerical Sequence
- Fibonacci: Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms.

- Arithmetic and Geometric Sequence: Generate an arithmetic or geometric sequence up to a user-defined number of terms.

## Installation

Clone or download the repository
Open the project in Visual Studio
Build and run the application
## How to Use

- Launch the application
- Select the tool you wish to use from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input any required parameters
- Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculation
- The result will be displayed on the right-hand side of the screen

## OOP Design

The application is designed using OOP principles to keep the code modular and easy to maintain. Each tool is represented by a separate class, with its own set of methods and properties for performing calculations. The main program loop is an infinite loop that continuously updates the GUI and listens for user input.


## Future Improvements

Some possible future improvements to this application could include adding more advanced mathematical tools, such as calculus or linear algebra. The application could also be made more visually appealing with improved graphics or animations. Additionally, adding a history feature that stores the results of previous calculations could enhance the user's experience.
